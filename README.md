## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The only JavaScript required is for the color theme toggle.

Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size;
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page;
- Toggle color theme to their preference;
